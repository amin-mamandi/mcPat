# mcPat

Basically, I have modified the "template.xml" file to parse the stats data for four cores. This is totally a hacky way. There should be another way to do that. 

I will update it once I figure it out. 

BTW, How to use it?

```
python2 pars.py ../m5out/stats.txt ../m5out/config.json template-o3.xml -o ./mcpat-out
```
